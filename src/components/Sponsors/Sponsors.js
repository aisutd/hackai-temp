          <ListParagraph>Today, AI is a buzzword thatâ€™s continuously mentioned. 
            Many students are unaware of what it means, its subtopics, and how they can get started.
              We hope to demystify this specialized niche in computer science and bring it forward to
               students through an AI-related hackathon. 
               We aim for our in-person event to provide both learning and competition opportunities and
                connect them to professionals who can further guide them in their AI journey. </ListParagraph>
