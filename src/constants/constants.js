It is an opportunity for users to track their water consumption and improve their health. Additionally, we plan to create features where they can see friend's water consumption and compete each other for water stats (though we are not sure if we will implement this feature any time soon).",

    title: 'Project Nebula Planner',
    description: "This is a project that was made by a small group of UTD students to make the transition from high school to college easier. It is a web application that allows users to create a plan for their college life where they list out all the courses they have taken and want to take. From the given input, the planner creates different paths of a 4-year plan based off of their prerequisites and corequisites. The planner also can be personalized to a user's needs where they will be shown a 2-year plan if enough credits suffice for that to happen.",
